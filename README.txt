INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING OUR CODE



1. CONTENTS ###################################################################
 
Both versions analyse the image contained in "mosaic.fits".

This folder contains two working versions of our code to obtain a galaxy number
count.

The version 1 is composed of 3 files:
    1. "A1_tools.py", which is a package containing all the routines needed to 
    analyse the image.
    
    2. "cleaning_data.py", which removes unwanted features from the image and
    creates a file, "modified_img.txt", containing the improved data.
    
    2. "img_analysis.py", which detects sources in the image and produces a txt
    file, "run2_calibrated_stats.txt", containing the calibrated source list.
    
    3. "analysing_calibrated_data.py", which analyses the file created by the 
    first program.
    
    4. "run1_calibrated_stats.txt", which contains data already collected to
    avoid having to fully run the programs.
    
The version 2 is composed of FILL HERE files:
    1. ...
    2. ...
